# Vim setup

This is my personal vim setup preferences.


## Usage
Clone repository renamed as `.vim` to initialize your vim environment.
Note that the `.vimrc` file is located inside this directory. As a result any pre-existing `.vimrc` file in home directory would get priority.
Either remove `~/.vimrc` or merge the two `.vimrc`s
