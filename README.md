# Vim setup

This is my personal vim setup preferences.


## Usage
Clone repository renamed as `.vim` to initialize your vim environment.
Note that the `vimrc` file is located inside this directory. Any pre-existing 
`.vimrc` file in home directory would have priority over this file. So, either 
remove `~/.vimrc` or merge the two `.vimrc`s
